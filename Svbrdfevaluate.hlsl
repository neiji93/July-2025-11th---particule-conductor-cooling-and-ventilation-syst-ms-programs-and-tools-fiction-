//yhe svbrdf models are complex enough and huge tondeal with
//15 MeV (i think so).

//first of all, lets notice the system base valued
//for adimensional propertied. we may be able to prevent
//clifford algebra here. so lets dample the device pribes 
//this will lead to another model or another esuation.
//as this is self trusted system, lets recognize the beam type
//by samoling probe kernels.
